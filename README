This collection of files is a basis for systemprogramming course at LUT-university.

my-cat.c
my-cat.c is an imitation of the cat command of linux systems. The idea is that the same way
you can use cat to print out a contents of a file, you can use ./my-cat [file1] [file2]...[fileN]
to do the same thing. my-cat.c prints out the files in order from left to right.
Usage: ./my-cat [file1] [file2]...[fileN]
Errors: no file given, error opening file


my-grep.c
my-grep much like the my-cat is an imitation of grep. 
It is used to find lines with given word or expression in a file or input. my-grep can be run 
without a file to look through in which case userinput will be taken. Userinput is given 
line by line and is ended with empty line(just an enter press) after which the whole group of lines given will be gone through for the lines with given expression.
Usage: ./my-grep searched_expression {[file]}
Errors: error opening file, error creating a structure 

my-zip.c
my-zip.c is a simple compression program that uses run-lenght coding to compress. the program itself will compress the given file into 5byte sized entries which have 4 byte integer that tells how many of the following 1 byte character there are at that point in the program.
Usage: ./my-unzip file >file.z
Errors:

my-unzip.c
my-unzip is the mirror of my-zip.c program. It uncompresses the program the opposite of the zip program. 
Usage: ./my-unzip File_to_be_uncompressed
Errors:
